HMMs and Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging

To modify the Viterbi algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques such as
Lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc

Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.

List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger and got corrected after your modifications.
